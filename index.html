            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems, or normally referred to as VCS, is used to manage the change and the structural configuration of an application. It is a cost-free process that is very important to projects that are being worked on by multiple developers at a time. This system allows for the users to monitor changes made to individual files within the project, and eventually merge files together. VCS is great for being able to track application builds by identifying current developments that are documented, which would make it significantly easier for new developers to come in and not miss a beat. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While Version Control Systems certainly have their benefits in making the process in which multiple developers can create, edit, and review files within a project; it still has its potential down falls. For instance, with so many people with unlimited access to all or most files in a project, certain project managers might take issue with having that many eyes overlooking a file. It may be detrimental to the success of the overall project, if there are too many developers micro-managing the code. Also, the security of files and the project as a whole could come into questions since the project is in the 'cloud'.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In the software development world, a repository is used as a central file storage location for version control systems in order to store multiple versions of files or projects. A repository is made up of three elements, a 'trunk', 'branches', and 'tags'. The trunk is used for storing the current software project, which includes files of source codes or other resources used in a project. A branch is normally used for when a developer wants to make a significant amount of changes to a version of a program. If the developer decides to discontinue the revisions, it will not affect the version in the project, but if the developer is satisfied with the changes it can easily be merged back into the project. Tags are important because they are used to title the saved versions of the object.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">How to Create a Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is typically referred to as the most widely used version control system in the coding world today.  Git is built to have quality performance, intense security, and flexibility in order to keep up with the demands of the various changes any coder could think of. If a developer is trying to create a project from a set of data that has been given. A ReadMe file must first be created to describe the project. Then it is important to connect to a local git repository system such as GitHub. Next you have to push your existing repository set with the developers GitHub link.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is an important tool, as it is a version traffic control system in order to track changes in files, but also for developers to manage their source codes in the software development. For example, a command available for developers to use is the 'git config' function. This is used for the configuration of values given such as user name, email, gpg key, or algorithims. Another command is the 'git init', which initializes the git repository in a new or existing project. While those are the most important git commands, there is also a 'git clone', 'git add' 'git rm', that can all be used to get whatever the developer may have in mind.</p>
